Error examples:
1. Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
# Python code:
money_initial = 23
bagels = 5
bagel_cost = 2 
money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
money_left = money_initial + money_spent 
ans = money_left

Judgment process:
The code snippet you provided has a mistake in the calculation of the remaining money. 
The error is in the line where 'money_left' is calculated. Instead of subtracting the 'money_spent' from 'money_initial', it incorrectly adds these values. 
This leads to a calculation that does not represent how much money Olivia has left after buying the bagels. 
The correct approach should subtract the total cost of the bagels from the initial amount of money. 
Also, there's another issue: the bagel cost in your code snippet is set to $2 each, whereas the problem states that each bagel costs $3. 
Here's how the corrected version of the code should look, with the correct cost per bagel and the correct operation to calculate the remaining money:
money_initial = 23
bagels = 5
bagel_cost = 3  # Corrected from 2 to 3 as per the problem statement
money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
money_left = money_initial - money_spent  # Changed '+' to '-'
ans = money_left
print(ans)
Therefore, the previous code was incorrect.

2. Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
# Python code:
golf_balls_initial = 58
golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial + golf_balls_lost_tuesday + golf_balls_lost_wednesday
ans = golf_balls_left

Judgment process:
The code you provided contains a logical error in how the golf balls left are calculated. In the code, it incorrectly adds the number of golf balls lost on Tuesday and Wednesday to the initial number of golf balls, rather than subtracting them.
Here's the corrected version of the code to reflect the right calculation:
golf_balls_initial = 58
golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday  # Corrected by using subtraction
ans = golf_balls_left
print(ans)
Therefore, the previous code was incorrect.

Decision: Error


3. Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
# Python code:
computers_initial = 9
computers_per_day = 5
num_days = 3
computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
computers_total = computers_initial - computers_added
ans = computers_total

Judgment process:
The provided Python code has a logical error related to the number of days during which computers were installed, and also the operation used to calculate the total number of computers in the server room.
First, the number of days from Monday to Thursday is four, not three. Therefore, you need to adjust num_days to 4.
Second, the final line of the code incorrectly subtracts the number of computers added from the initial count. Since computers are being added, you should add the number of computers installed to the initial amount.
Here's how the corrected version of the code should look:
computers_initial = 9
computers_per_day = 5
num_days = 4  # Corrected from 3 to 4 (Monday to Thursday inclusive)
computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added  # Changed '-' to '+'
ans = computers_total
print(ans)
Therefore, the previous code was incorrect.

4. Question: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?
# Python code:
toys_initial = 5
mom_toys = 2
dad_toys = 2
total_received = mom_toys * dad_toys
total_toys = toys_initial * total_received
ans = total_toys

Judgment process:
The provided Python code contains errors in how it calculates the total number of toys Shawn has after receiving additional toys from his mom and dad. The code incorrectly multiplies the toys received from mom and dad together, and then further multiplies this result with the initial number of toys. This is not the correct approach for this problem.
To solve this correctly, you should add the number of toys received from both parents to the initial number of toys. Here’s the corrected version of the code:
toys_initial = 5
mom_toys = 2
dad_toys = 2
total_received = mom_toys + dad_toys  # Changed from multiplication to addition
total_toys = toys_initial + total_received  # Use addition to combine initial toys with those received
ans = total_toys
print(ans) 
Therefore, the previous code was incorrect.

Decision: Error



Right examples:
1. Question: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?
# Python code:
jason_lollipops_initial = 20
jason_lollipops_after = 12
denny_lollipops = jason_lollipops_initial - jason_lollipops_after
ans = denny_lollipops

Judgment process:
The Python code provided for the question is correct. It accurately computes the number of lollipops Jason gave to Denny by subtracting the number of lollipops Jason has after giving some away from the initial number he had. Here's a breakdown:
Initial lollipops: Jason started with 20 lollipops.
Lollipops after giving some to Denny: Jason has 12 lollipops left.
Calculation: The number of lollipops Jason gave to Denny is determined by subtracting the number he has left from the number he started with, which is 20-12=8.
The code correctly calculates that Jason gave Denny 8 lollipops. The logic and implementation in the code are correct for solving this problem.

Decision: Right


2. Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
# Python code:
leah_chocolates = 32
sister_chocolates = 42
total_chocolates = leah_chocolates + sister_chocolates
chocolates_eaten = 35
chocolates_left = total_chocolates - chocolates_eaten
ans = chocolates_left

Judgment process:
The Python code you provided is correct for solving the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
Leah's initial chocolates: 32 chocolates.
Her sister's initial chocolates: 42 chocolates.
Total chocolates: The sum of Leah's and her sister's chocolates, which is 32+42=74.
Chocolates eaten: They ate 35 chocolates together.
Chocolates left: The number of chocolates left after eating 35, calculated by 74-35=39.
Thus, the code correctly calculates that they have 39 pieces of chocolate left in total after they ate 35.

Decision: Right


3. Question: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
# Python code:
cars_initial = 3
cars_arrived = 2
total_cars = cars_initial + cars_arrived
ans = total_cars

Judgment process:
The Python code you provided is correct for solving the problem. It accurately calculates the total number of cars in the parking lot after more cars arrive. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
Initial number of cars: There are initially 3 cars in the parking lot.
Cars that arrived: 2 more cars arrive.
Total cars: The total number of cars is then calculated by adding the initial number of cars to the number of cars that arrived, which is 3+2=5.

Decision: Right


4. Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
# Python code:
trees_initial = 15
trees_after = 21
trees_added = trees_after - trees_initial
ans = trees_added

Judgment process:
The Python code you provided is correct for solving the problem as described. It accurately calculates the number of trees the grove workers planted today by subtracting the initial number of trees from the total number of trees after planting. Here’s a breakdown of the logic:
Initial number of trees: There are initially 15 trees in the grove.
Number of trees after planting: After planting, there are 21 trees.
Calculation: The number of trees planted by the grove workers today is determined by subtracting the initial number of trees from the number after planting, which is  21−15=6.
Thus, the code correctly calculates that the grove workers planted 6 trees today.

Decision: Right
